        My journey with HTML5 and CSS3 begin 2 a fortnight ago. I am continously
        grasping this skills and I felt it quite entangling with all the vivid
        designs and layouts using flexbox. One with a good amount of design
        knowledge and its keywords can ace this language. With the touch of CSS3
        Flexbox HTML has really become an interactive source on a web browser.

        I started my Coding journey with python ,when I was in grade 10th,
        developed interests and created a complex calculator a month later after
        it. Python libraries were a great help in this process. Though python is
        a bit slow language yet it has immense applications in Machine learning
        and artificial intelligence.

        C++ is an extremely useful language and the core fundamental of all the
        applications running around the world. It is a very fast language and
        hence used in building heavy games and applications.I first learned it
        in my college and secured an A grade in it. I have also been working on
        competitive programming in this domain.
